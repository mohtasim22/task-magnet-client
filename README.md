## Project Features
1. User can log in and register to the site using Firebase Auth.

3. Users will be able to create new tasks with titles, descriptions, deadlines, and priority. (Low, moderate, high, etc.)
4. As soon as a task is added, it will be shown on the to-do list of the task management dashboard.
5. There will be three separate lists of to-do, ongoing, and completed. You have to Implement the drag-and-drop functionality so that the user can drag a task from ‘to-do’ to ‘ongoing’ or from ‘ongoing’ to ‘completed’. Or from any option to another option.
6. Used the react hook form to create the tasks. 
7. Users can delete any tasks from the task management dashboard. However, the user must first log in to explore the task management dashboard.
